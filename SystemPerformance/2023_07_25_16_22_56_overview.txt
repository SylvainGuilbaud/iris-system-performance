Passes:
- Kernel shared memory limit is at default

Warnings:
- ** Insecure Private Webserver Enabled! **
- Journal freeze on error is not enabled. If journal IO errors occur database activity that occurs during this period cannot be restored. 
- Primary Journal is the same as Alternate Journal
- gmheap 0 size does not support parallel dejournaling
- locksiz 0 is less than IRIS default (16777216)
- WIJ in Installation Directory
- swappiness is 60. For databases 5 is recommended to adjust how aggressive the Linux kernel swaps memory pages to disk. 
- memlock=0 does not enforce Huge/Large pages
- HugePages are not set. Consider huge page memory space for production instances to improve performance and efficiency and to protect the shared memory from paging out. Specifying HugePages much higher than the shared memory amount is not advisable because the unused memory is not available to other components.

Recommendations:
- Review and fix warnings above
- Set HugePages, see IRIS documentation: https://docs.intersystems.com/irislatest/csp/docbook/Doc.View.cls?KEY=GCI_prepare_install#GCI_memory_big_linux 
- Total memory is 15,987 MB, 75% of total memory is 11,990 MB.
- Shared memory (globals+routines+gmheap+other) is 0 MB. (0% of total memory).
- Number of HugePages for 2048 KB page size for 380 MB is 190
